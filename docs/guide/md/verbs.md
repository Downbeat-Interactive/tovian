# Verbs & Aspects

Tovian uses a conjugated auxiliary + an infinitive main verb.

- Tense suffixes on the auxiliary: `-e` past, `-a` present, `-o` future.
- The main verb remains an infinitive (unchanged).

## Examples

- `fa mrila.` — English: [He/She] sees. (simple present)
- `sha fethr.` — English: is speaking. (progressive present)
- `tlotema …` — English: should habitually … (obligative + habitual present)

## Agreement

- 2nd person `-o`
- 3rd person `-a`

Plural is a noun suffix `-e`; verbs do not agree with number.
