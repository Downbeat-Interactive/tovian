# Pronouns & Agreement

Independent pronouns are often unnecessary because the auxiliary verb carries person via a suffix. Use full pronouns when emphasis or clarity is needed; otherwise, person is recoverable from the auxiliary.

Person suffixes (on the auxiliary)

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Person</th><th>Suffix</th><th>Example</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1st</td><td><code>-i</code></td><td><code>sa nalhi</code> “I/we think” (context decides number)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2nd</td><td><code>-o</code></td><td><code>sa nalho</code> “you think”</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3rd</td><td><code>-a</code></td><td><code>sa nalha</code> “he/she/they think”</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Notes

- Plurality appears on nouns with <code>-e</code> (e.g., <code>lothr → lothre</code>), not on verbs.
- Full pronouns may precede the verb for emphasis in formal or contrastive contexts; otherwise, rely on verbal agreement.
