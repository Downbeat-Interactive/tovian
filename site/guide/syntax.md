# Syntax & Word Order

Canonical word order is historically SOV (Subject–Object–Verb):

- <code>la-yel ti-lo-shithil fa mril</code> — “The person sees in the city.”

Modern Tovian allows fronting for emphasis. Elements can be moved to the beginning for focus, while case marking preserves roles:

- <code>ti-lo-shithil la-yel fa mril</code> — “In the city, the person sees.”

**Important**: attributive nouns (adjectives) follow the nouns they modify and should remain adjacent:

- <code>la-yel ti-lo-shithil mot fa mril</code> — “The person sees the big city.”
- <code>ti-lo-shithil la-yel mot fa mril</code> — “The big person sees the city.” (meaning changes)
