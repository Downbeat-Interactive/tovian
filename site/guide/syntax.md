# Syntax & Word Order

Canonical word order is historically SOV (Subject–Object–Verb):

- <code>la-driel ti-lo-shithil fa mrila</code> — “The person sees in the city.”

Modern Tovian allows fronting for emphasis. Elements can be moved to the beginning for focus, while case marking preserves roles:

- <code>ti-lo-shithil la-driel fa mrila</code> — “In the city, the person sees.”

**Important**: attributive nouns (adjectives) follow the nouns they modify and should remain adjacent:

- <code>la-driel ti-lo-shithil mot fa mrila</code> — “The person sees the big city.”
- <code>ti-lo-shithil la-driel mot fa mrila</code> — “The big person sees the city.” (meaning changes)
