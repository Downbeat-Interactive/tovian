# Introductions

Polite self-introductions and first phrases. Memory and dreams now live in their own section.

## Polite Name Request

- `si-lhan wa tlotema nalori ti-le-elom hiwa?`  
  English: How should I bind myself in your memory?

- `hletema naloro ti-le-elom hina: [Name/Epithet].`  
  English: Please bind me in my memory as [Name/Epithet].


## Quick introductions (template)

When meeting someone, a quick pattern is:

- <code>na fa [Name].</code> — I am [Name].

Optionally add a friendly acknowledgement:

- <code>wa fa fethro.</code> — You speak.

Common quick question:

- <code>lhan wa fa?</code> — Who are you?
