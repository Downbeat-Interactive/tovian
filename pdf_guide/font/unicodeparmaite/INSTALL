Please, consult your (La)TeX administrator, a (La)TeX guru, or the (La)TeX
documentation to know what to do with the files

parmaite.pfb (PostScript Type 1 font binary data)
parmaite.tfm (TeX font metric data)
tengwar.map  (map to create psfonts.map, ps2pk.map and pdftex.map for DVIPS)

so that you can use them with a (La)TeX system. When done, you can check the
font and its availability by running the (pdf)tex program on fontchart.tex
or testfont.tex and by answering "parmaite" to the question on the font.
