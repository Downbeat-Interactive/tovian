This file is the README file for Tengwar Parmaite encoded following Tenwgar
proposal to Unicode.

Program afm2tfm automatically generated the file parmaite.tfm from the file
parmaite.afm, and this file has been manually edited from a former version.

PfaEdit 1.0 (http://pfaedit.sf.net/) automatically generated the files
parmaite.pfb and the former version of parmaite.afm from the file
UnicodeTengwarParmaite.sfd .

This last file has been created by Conrado Badenas with PfaEdit 1.0,
following Tengwar proposal to Unicode by Michael Everson
(http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n1641/n1641.htm linked from
http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp) by recoding (and modifying slightly
some glyphs of) the file Parmaite.ttf .

This last file is the Tengwar font by Måns Björkman © 1998-2002 included
(with very interesting documentation) in the file Parmaite12b.zip,
which is also available in http://hem.passagen.se/mansb/at/parmaite.htm .
